# Basic PyBadge Project

A simple [PyBadge](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4200) project that is a badge to wear at events.

Alternates between showing the basic name badge, a more elaborate one with job description and company, and a QR code for my portfolio.

Usage:
- A button advances.
- B button goes back.
- Start button pauses auto-switching. Pressing A or B reenables it.
